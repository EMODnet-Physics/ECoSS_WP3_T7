## POETRY CONFIGURATION:
1. Go to the root of the project and create a venv named "poetryenv".
2. Activate the venv
3. pip install poetry
4. Go to the root of the project
5. poetry install (this will install all the packages and dependencies listed in poetry.lock and pyproject.toml files)

If you would like to install a new package inside the environment and its dependencies, you simply need to activate the environment manually and do "poetry add package-name" inside the root of the project.
